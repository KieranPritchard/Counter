## Project Description

This project is a counter, its purpose is to the increase and decrease of the number displayed on screen.

the reason for this project was to continue learning about how websites are built; work with html,css and javascript; a websites inner workings; and DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.

with this project there was a couple of problems with the code, then another with styling which was due to me being a perfectionist. the first problem with the code was the colour of the number defaulting to black when the number is reset, this was fixed my making a function in the javascript code to change the colour of the counter to match certain criteria. the second problem was with showing the increase/decrease of the counter, i fixed this by making the web page display the value of the varible container the current number of the varible.
